These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.:Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.:On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.:The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.",

      "description": "Treadmill walking is a popular cardiovascular exercise performed on a machine that is available in most gyms. Performing this exercise on a treadmill allows you to adjust the speed of your walking and, depending on the machine, perform it on an adjustable incline. Many machines also have built-in heart rate monitors and timers to help you track your progress.",
      "instructions": "To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.:Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than walking outside. When walking, you should move at a moderate to fast pace, not a leisurely one. Being an activity of lower intensity, walking doesnâ€™t burn as many calories as some other activities, but still provides great benefit. A 150 lb person will burn about 175 calories walking 4 miles per hour for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories running twice as fast. Maintain proper posture as you walk, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.",

Working the chest one side at a time allows you to focus on the balance between the sides of your chest and really feel the chest muscles contracting. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.",
      "instructions": "Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position, select the resistance to be used, and take a handle in each hand.:Step forward in front of both pulleys with your arms extended in front of you, bringing your hands together. Your head and chest should be up as you lean forward, while your feet should be staggered. This will be your starting position.:Keeping your left arm in place, allow your right arm to extend out to the side, maintaining a slight bend at the elbow. The right arm should be perpendicular to the body at approximately shoulder level.:Return your arm back to the starting position by pulling your hand back to the midline of the body.:Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement on the opposite side.

Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips.:There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles.:The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.",

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.:With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.:Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head.

Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended.:Place the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet.:Your back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted.:Keep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.:Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle.

Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.:Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.:Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.:When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.:As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.:Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.:After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.:Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.:Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.:Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.:Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.:Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.:Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.:Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.:Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.:Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.:As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.:Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.:The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.:Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.:At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.",

      "description": "The decline bar press sit-up is a weighted core exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the lower abs. It also challenges the shoulders and upper back to move the weight. Weighted sit-up variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the core-focused portion of a workout.",
      "instructions": "To begin, lie down on a bench with a barbell resting on your chest. Position your legs so they are secure on the extension of the abdominal bench. This is the starting position.:While inhaling, tighten your abdominals and glutes. Simultaneously curl your torso as you do when performing a sit-up and press the barbell to an overhead position while exhaling. Tip: Use your arms to push the barbell out as you perform this exercise while still focusing on the abdominal muscles.:Lower your upper body back down to the starting position while bringing the barbell back down to your torso. Remember to breathe in while lowering the body.:Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

      "description": "The exercise ball crunch is a popular gym exercise targeting the abdominals. Unlike crunches on the floor or a bench, by using a ball you can increase the range of motion and both stretch and contract the abs on every rep. The ball crunch can be performed for low reps with a slower tempo focusing on a hard contraction, or for higher reps.",
      "instructions": "Lie on an exercise ball with your lower back curvature pressed against the spherical surface of the ball. Your feet should be bent at the knee and pressed firmly against the floor. The upper torso should be hanging off the top of the ball. The arms should either be kept alongside the body or crossed on top of your chest as these positions avoid neck strains (as opposed to the hands behind the back of the head position).:Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position.:With the hips stationary, flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second.:As you inhale, go back to the starting position.:Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

You should be approximately armâ€™s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable.:With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, reach upward with your other hand and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended.:In one motion, pull the handle down and across your body to your front knee while rotating your torso.:Keep your back and arms straight and core tight while you pivot your back foot and bend your knees to get a full range of motion.:Maintain your stance and straight arms. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner.:Repeat to failure.:Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.",

      "description": "The machine crunch is a machine-based exercise targeting the abdominal muscles. It involves sitting upright in the machine and curling the torso down toward the chest against some pre-set level of resistance. On some machines, the knees also curl up torward the torso. Crunch machines usually use extra resistance in the form of selectorized weight stacks or plate loading, and are often performed for moderate to high reps, like 8-12 reps per set or higher, as part of the ab-focused portion of a workout.",
      "instructions": "Select a light resistance and sit down on the ab machine placing your feet under the pads provided and grabbing the top handles. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you rest the triceps on the pads provided. This will be your starting position.:At the same time, begin to lift the legs up as you crunch your upper torso. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion. Concentrate on using your abs to move the weight while relaxing your legs and feet.:After a second pause, slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.:Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.:For this exercise, always select a weight that you can easily handle as using too much weight can easily lead to injury.",
